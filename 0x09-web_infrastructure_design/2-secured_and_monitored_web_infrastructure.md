/**
Secured and monitored web infrastructure
1.	Additional elements: 
•	3 firewalls: Added layers of security and protect against different types of attacks. The firewalls act as a barrier between the internet and the web infrastructure, allowing only authorized traffic to pass through.
•	1 SSL: This serves as encrypted traffic to ensure that the data transmitted between the website and its users is protected from interception and tampering.
•	3 monitoring clients: These are meant to detect and alert on issues within the web infrastructure. They are data collectors for a monitoring service, such as Sumologic. These monitoring clients collect data from different components of the web infrastructure, such as the web server and MySQL database, and send it to the monitoring service for analysis and alerting. These clients monitor the web server's QPS (Queries Per Second), collect data on the number of queries the web server receives per second, while collecting metrics related to its performance, and analyzing those metrics to calculate the QPS.

2.	Specifics About This Infrastructure:
•	What are firewalls for: Firewalls add a layer of security to the web infrastructure, by controlling access to the network and the services running on it. It/they act(s) as a barrier between the internet and the web infrastructure, allowing only authorized traffic to pass through. 
Firewalls typically use a set of rules to filter incoming and outgoing traffic based on specific criteria, such as the source and destination IP addresses, port numbers, and protocols. This helps to block malicious traffic and prevent attacks, such as DDoS attacks, port scanning, and unauthorized access attempts.
•	The purpose of the SSL certificate: The purpose of an SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) certificate in a web infrastructure is to provide encryption and authentication for the traffic between the website and its users. SSL is a protocol that uses encryption to protect sensitive information, such as login credentials, credit card details, and other personal data, from being intercepted or tampered with by attackers. An SSL certificate is a digital certificate that authenticates the identity of a website and encrypts the data being transmitted between the website and the user's browser. When a user visits a website with an SSL certificate, their browser establishes a secure connection to the website's server and encrypts all data transmitted between them. This helps to protect the user's privacy and ensure the integrity of the data being transmitted.
•	What monitoring clients are used for: Monitoring clients in a web infrastructure collects and analyze data about the system's performance, availability, and security. Monitoring is essential for ensuring that the web infrastructure is running smoothly and is available to users at all times.
•	How the monitoring tool is collecting data: Monitoring clients can collect data from various sources, including servers, applications, network devices, and databases. This data can be used to identify and troubleshoot issues, such as server downtime, high server load, network congestion, or security breaches. Monitoring can also provide insights into system usage patterns, trends, and anomalies, which can help to optimize system performance and prevent future issues.
3.	Issues With This Infrastructure:
•	Why terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue: Terminating SSL at the load balancer level would leave the traffic between the load balancer and the web servers unencrypted.
•	Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue: Having one MySQL server is an issue because it is not scalable and can act as a single point of failure (SPOF) for the web infrastructure.
•	Why having servers with all the same components (database, web server and application server) might be a problem: Having servers with all the same components would make the components contend for resources on the server like CPU, Memory, I/O, etc., which can lead to poor performance and also make it difficult to locate the source of the problem. A setup such as this is not easily scalable.
